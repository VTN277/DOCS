## What is S3?
- Simple Storage Service
- Use cases: data lakes, websites, mobile apps, backup & restore, archiving, enterprise apps, IoT, Big Data & Analytics

## Key Features of S3
- Managed Service (no infrastructure management)
- Object storage (0 - 5TB per file)
- High Durability (11 9s), Scalability, High Availability (99.99%)
- Versatile use cases
- Multiple storage classes for cost optimization
- Granular access control
- Easy integration with other AWS services

## S3 Core Features
1. Storage classes
2. Storage management (Life Cycle, Object Lock, Replication, Batch Operation)
3. Access Management
4. Data processing
5. Auto Logging and Monitoring
6. Analytics and insights
7. Strong consistency for read-after-write operations

## S3 Integration with AWS Services
- EC2, Containers, Lambda for file storage
- Log storage for AWS services
- Data source for big data & data warehouse
- IoT device data storage
- ETL processes with Lambda
- Static website hosting with CloudFront

## Lab 1: S3 Basic Operations
1. AWS console login and S3 navigation
2. Bucket creation
3. Folder creation
4. File/folder upload
5. File moving
6. File download
7. Object metadata editing
8. File deletion

## S3 Bucket Policy and Access Control List
- Resource Level Policy support
- Similar to IAM Policy but bucket-scoped
- Controls access (allow/deny) to bucket and its contents
- Suitable for high-security requirements

### Bucket Policy Examples
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Allow_riccardo_read",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": ["arn:aws:iam::614073292094:user/riccardo"]
      },
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::abc-bucket-sample-001/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Deny_ronaldo_all",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": ["arn:aws:iam::614073292094:user/ronaldo"]
      },
      "Action": ["s3:*"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::abc-bucket-sample-001/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Access Control List (ACL)
- Specifies access rights for AWS Accounts or user groups
- Used for specific resource access without changing bucket policy
- AWS recommends using bucket policy, IAM policy & pre-signed URLs instead of ACL

## Lab 2: S3 Access Control List
1. File upload
2. Public access modification
3. Access testing without login

## S3 Versioning
- Stores multiple versions of objects
- Prevents accidental deletions or overwrites
- Increases storage costs
- Version history persists after disabling

## Lab 3: Versioning
1. File preparation
2. Versioning activation
3. File upload and version creation
4. File deletion and restoration
5. Versioning deactivation and behavior testing

## S3 Presigned URL
- Temporary public access to S3 objects
- Time-limited download/upload permissions
- Use cases: temporary access, user authentication, preventing indefinite public access

## Lab 4: Presigned URL (CLI)
1. AWS CLI setup
2. File upload to S3
3. Presigned URL generation
4. URL testing
5. Expiration verification

## S3 Storage Classes
- Multiple classes for cost optimization
- Selection factors: durability, availability, storage duration, access frequency, use case

### Storage Class Types
1. S3 Standard
2. S3 Intelligent Tiering
3. S3 Standard Infrequent Access (IA)
4. S3 One Zone-IA
5. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
6. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
7. S3 Glacier Deep Archive
8. S3 Outposts

## Lab 5: Storage Class Practice
1. File uploads with different storage classes
2. Access testing for Glacier Deep Archive
3. File cleanup

## S3 Lifecycle Management
- Automatic object transition between storage classes
- Deletion after specified time
- Useful for log storage optimization

## Lab 6: S3 Static Website Hosting
1. Static HTML source preparation
2. S3 upload
3. Static web hosting activation
4. Public access configuration
5. Bucket policy setup
6. Browser access testing

## S3 Event Triggers
- Event notification on object changes
- Integration with Lambda, SNS, SQS
- Use cases: image resizing, file unzipping, data processing, deletion notifications

## Lab 7: S3 Event with Lambda Integration
1. Simple Lambda function creation
2. S3 trigger setup
3. Upload testing
4. Lambda execution verification

## S3 Best Practices
- Region alignment with applications
- Bucket policy for important data
- Versioning for data protection
- Data encryption
- TLS enforcement
- VPC endpoint usage
- CloudFront integration for static web hosting

## Resource Cleanup
1. S3 bucket deletion
2. EC2 instance termination
3. Lambda function retention (optional)

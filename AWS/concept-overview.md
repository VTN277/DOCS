# AWS Fundamental Concepts

## 1. Regions and Availability Zones (AZs)
- Regions: Geographical areas with multiple data centers
- AZs: Isolated locations within a region
- Provides high availability and fault tolerance

## 2. EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
- Virtual servers in the cloud
- Scalable computing capacity
- Various instance types for different use cases

## 3. S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- Object storage service
- Highly scalable and reliable
- Used for backup, archiving, and data lakes

## 4. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- Isolated section of AWS cloud
- Control over virtual networking environment
- Allows creation of subnets and network configurations

## 5. IAM (Identity and Access Management)
- Manages access to AWS services securely
- Create and manage users, groups, and roles
- Implements principle of least privilege

## 6. CloudFormation
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service
- Define and provision AWS infrastructure using templates
- Enables consistent, repeatable deployments

## 7. Lambda
- Serverless compute service
- Runs code in response to events
- Automatically scales based on requests

## 8. RDS (Relational Database Service)
- Managed relational database service
- Supports multiple database engines
- Handles routine database tasks

## 9. CloudWatch
- Monitoring and observability service
- Collects metrics, logs, and events
- Allows setting alarms and automating actions

## 10. Auto Scaling
- Automatically adjusts number of EC2 instances
- Maintains application availability
- Scales capacity based on defined conditions

These concepts form the foundation of many AWS architectures and work together to create scalable, reliable, and efficient cloud solutions.
